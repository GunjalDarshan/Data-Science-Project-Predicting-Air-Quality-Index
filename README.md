# Predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) using Machine Learning
## Description
  This project focuses on predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. The AQI is a measure of air pollution levels and is crucial for assessing and monitoring air quality in different locations. By accurately forecasting the AQI, proactive measures can be taken to mitigate pollution and improve the overall air quality.
The project utilizes a dataset of historical air quality data, including various features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutant concentrations. Machine learning algorithms are applied to learn patterns from this data and make predictions of the AQI for future time periods.

## Dataset

  The dataset used for this project consists of historical air quality data and corresponding AQI values. The dataset includes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pollutant concentrations (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2). The dataset is not included in this repository, but you can obtain similar air quality datasets from government agencies or research institutions.

## Methodology

The project follows the following steps to predict the AQI:

1. Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies. Feature engineering techniques may be applied to extract additional meaningful features from the raw data.

2. Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected based on their correlation with the target variable (AQI). This helps in reducing the dimensionality of the dataset and improving model performance.

3. Model Training: Various machine learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting are employed to train a model using the preprocessed dataset. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts the AQI values.

5. Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data to forecast the AQI values for future time periods. Preprocessing steps similar to the training data should be applied to ensure compatibility with the model.

## Results

  The performance of the machine learning model in predicting the AQI can be summarized using evaluation metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R-squared score. These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the model's accuracy and predictive power.

  In addition to the evaluation metrics, visualizations such as line plots and scatter plots can be generated to compare the predicted AQI values with the actual values. These visualizations help in understanding the model's performance and identifying any patterns or trends in the predictions.

  Based on the evaluation metrics and visualizations, the model's performance can be analyzed to determine its effectiveness in forecasting the AQI. The insights gained from this project can contribute to better air quality monitoring and management, enabling proactive measures to reduce pollution and improve public health.

## Conclusion

  The Predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to forecast the AQI based on historical air quality data. By training a machine learning model on relevant features, accurate predictions can be made to monitor and predict air pollution levels. The project provides a foundation for further research and development in air quality prediction and contributes to environmental monitoring and sustainable development efforts.
